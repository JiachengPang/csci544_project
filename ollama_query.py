Entailment means the hypothesis is definitely a true description of the premise;

Contradiction means the hypothesis is definitely false given the premise;

Neutral means the hypothesis is might be a true description of the premise, but there is no direct evidence to support it.

For example:

Question:
Premise: A man in a tank top fixing himself a hotdog.
Hypothesis: The child was happy.

Answer: {{"relationship": "neutral","reason": "There's no direct link suggesting that the manâ€™s action would make the child happy, nor is there any contradiction between the two. They describe different subjects and unrelated situations. Hence, they are neutral."}}

You are asked to answer the following question:

Premise: {premise} 
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
